          <!-- Question 1 -->
          <li>
            What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
            the experience?
            <p>
              I find the bold color palette, art style and playful animation are
              very appealing. It gives a sense of fun and energetic, aligning
              with the their creative identity perfectly. I also think that
              smooth transitions and bouncy interactions are what attract users
              to the experience.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 2 -->
          <li>
            Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
            your discrete actions.
            <p>
              In two minutes, my main actions were clicking, scrolling, and
              choosing different activities. I played basketball, football, and
              boxing, ect then moved between sections quickly. Each action felt
              smooth and well-integrated, with minimal friction. My interaction
              was experimental yet fluid: click, observe, and move on. This
              shows the experience is designed for quick, fun and easy
              interactions without requiring long focus or deep navigation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 3 -->
          <li>
            What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
            with?
            <p>
              I spent the most time interacting with the animated items, as they
              invited me to test and play. I personally think the responsiveness
              of these elements made the experience more engaging. I enjoyed the
              sense of control and discovery in seeing how each item reacted,
              which demonstrates the effectiveness of motion-driven design in
              holding user attention.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 4 -->
          <li>
            What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
            the experience?
            <p>
              My most common actions were clicking and scrolling. The
              interaction design is built around these simple gestures, which
              makes it intuitive and easy to navigate. Every click felt
              rewarding because it triggered a fun response, while scrolling
              revealed new surprises, even though the transition was slightly
              slow in my opinion. This simplicity reinforces exploration while
              staying low effort. I personally liked it because it did not make
              me think, and seemed like developers had taken user actions and
              feedback considerably.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 5 -->
          <li>
            What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
            interactive experience?
            <p>
              The primary goal is to provide fun, lighthearted engagement that
              showcases creativity through playful interaction. Rather than
              focusing on efficiency or delivering information, it invites users
              into an imaginative digital playground where curiosity drives
              exploration. Functionally, its purpose is to create a memorable
              impression through the integration of interaction, animation, and
              design.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 6 -->
          <li>
            How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
            <p>
              The interactive experience communicates its goal through its
              playful visual language. Bright colors, bold shapes, and lively
              animations instantly signal that this is about fun and creativity.
              It feels like a digital playground, encouraging users to
              experiment freely. The seamless flow between sections also
              supports this, making it feel like one continuous, entertaining
              environment.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 7 -->
          <li>
            What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
            with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
            <p>
              The experience feels designed for short, repeatable sessions
              rather than long, sustained use. Each visit can be quick and
              casual, yet still rewarding, which encourages replay and discovery
              of new elements. However, the movement and transition between
              sections could be faster, as sometimes the slower pace disrupts
              the playful rhythm and the flow of thoughts. Overall, it works
              best as a snackable experience rather than something users prefer
              to have quick access to main information.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 8 -->
          <li>
            How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
            interacted with over time?
            <p>
              The design communicates a sense of openness and endlessness. There
              is not a fixed endpoint or pressure. It feels like you can stay as
              long as you want, or just dip in quickly. This freedom is
              supported by loop-like interactions, where animations and
              activities do not end but can be repeated infinitely. Therefore, I
              think the interactive experience has served its purpose as an
              invitation to return multiple times, rather than complete
              everything in one go.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 9 -->
          <li>
            What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
            reference?
            <p>
              The experience clearly references gaming, both in aesthetics and
              interaction style. The animations and playful mini-interactions
              reminded me of casual mobile games, where the focus is quick fun
              rather than heavy storytelling. The sporty elements, like
              basketball and boxing, also give it a gamified feeling. To me,
              these references make the design feel instantly familiar by
              borrowing the accessibility of gaming to create a lighthearted
              digital playground. It has a clever use of cultural cues that
              guide behavior intuitively.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 10 -->
          <li>
            What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
            act when engaging with your research experience?
            <p>
              The gaming reference communicates that mistakes do not exist here,
              only opportunities to explore. I felt relaxed and encouraged to
              approach the experience with curiosity and openness, as if I were
              playing a casual game. It suggested that the best way to engage is
              not passively but interactively, taking action and seeking
              surprises. This design choice effectively sets a tone of freedom
              and creativity, in my opinion.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 11 -->
          <li>
            What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
            feel when engaging with your research experience?
            <p>
              When engaging with my research experience, I should have fun
              rather than approach it seriously. It creates a light, joyful
              mood, similar to how one feels when opening a casual game app. The
              designs emotional intent was successful. I think users should feel
              amused, curious, and engaged while browsing rather than feeling
              stressed or pressured. To me, this emotional design choice makes
              the experience memorable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 12 -->
          <li>
            What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
            makes that part frustrating?
            <p>
              The most frustrating part was the long loading time, which
              disrupted thinking flow. Another frustration was that Luni Life
              lacked interactivity compared to other sections, creating a sense
              of imbalance. I also felt slightly impatient, as the design had
              set me up to expect constant action and responsiveness. The
              interaction design would benefit from reducing wait times.
            </p>
          </li>
          <!-- Question 13 -->
          <li>
            What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
            makes that part satisfying?
            <p>
              The most satisfying part was interacting with the animated items
              and seeing immediate feedback. Each click or scroll felt rewarding
              because it triggered a fun, lively response. The whole experience
              feels alive. I have learned from this strong interaction design:
              the feedback loop between action and response should be fast,
              intuitive, and enjoyable.
